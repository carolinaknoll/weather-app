##### Known bugs  
â€“ Weather-app [project website](https://carolinaknoll.github.io/weather-app/) might not function correctly due to GitHub's rule to only serve  `https` versions of content. Currently, Open Weather API only supports `http` requests, which are often blocked by browsers due to having mixed content.
